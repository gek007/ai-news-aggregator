I want to create: AI news aggregator where I can take multiple sources, for example, YouTube channels, blog post from openai and antropic and I want to scrape news and put it into a database where we have some kind of structure where we have sources, let's call them articles and then what I want to do is to run a daily digest where we're going to take all of these articles from within the time frame and we're going to do an LLM summary and we can generate a daily digest which is going to be short snippets with a link to the original source. now from the YouTube channels I want to be able to create a list of channels and then we want to get the latest videos from those channels I think we can use the YouTube that weekend scrape. I want everything built in a python backhand. I want to use a postgreSQL database, I want to use SQL Alchemy in order to define the database models and then also create tables. I want the project structure to be an app folder where all the app logic is in and then also want a darker folder where we first create the very minimal setup for the database and then that will probably be starting point and then also schedule it every 24 hours to run reports get everything and then when we create the daily digest I want to send an email to my personal inbox with this. so that's what I have in mind I think that would be pretty cool to build.
